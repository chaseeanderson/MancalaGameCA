# <p style="text-align: center;">MANCALA</p>
## GA PROJECT 1 // A WEB BROWSER-BASED GAME  
&nbsp;
#### This is an interactive browser-based game based on the game of the game Mancala.
&nbsp;
> _Mancala is a generic name for a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. 
> The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's pieces.
> Versions of the game date back to the 7th century and evidence suggests the game existed in Ancient Egypt. 
>It is among the oldest known games to still be widely played today. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala)_

### Getting Started
Below is a link that will direct you to the game. 
To begin simply click any of the middle 6 spaces on the top row of the board. 

To toggle the background noise, click the Play/Pause button on the top right corner of the screen. 

When the game is over, click the Play Again button if you'd like to go another round!

### Next Steps
Items I would love to add in the future include:

* A responsive design for smaller screens. 
* Adding a flickering effect to 'Mancala' title.
